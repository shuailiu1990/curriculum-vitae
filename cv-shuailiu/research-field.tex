\entry*[GW astronomy]
    My primary research at present is to explore promising gravitational wave (GW) sources for space-borne GW detectors, such as
    stellar mass binary black holes inspirals, intermediate mass binary black hole mergers, as well as hierachical
    triple systems consisting of black holes. 
\entry*[Holographic superconductor]
    I previously studied superconductors by holographic approach or anti-deSitter spacetime/conformal field theory
    (AdS/CFT) correspondence, specifically investigating the Josephson junction.
