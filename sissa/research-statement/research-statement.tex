I have been focusing on exploring black holes by future gravitational wave detectors, since I was a PhD candiate.
Specially, I work on investigating detection capacity of detectors (e.g., LISA and TianQin) for stellar- and
intermediate-mass black holes as well as massive black holes, and studying their formation and evolution.

During my PhD study, I worked on stellar-mass black holes. I assessed detection capacity of future space-borne detectors
LISA and TianQin for stellar-mass binary black holes. Specially, I estimated detection number and measurement precision for
source parameters by Fisher information matrix, and studied possbility to constrain their formation scenarios by
measuring their orbital eccentricities. I also investigated the improvement for detection capacity by joint
observation of TianQin and LISA.

I am working on intermediate-mass black holes during my postdoctoral period. In past one more years, I focused on
GW190521-like binary black holes whose merger remnants are intermediate-mass black holes. I made estimation on detection
capacity of TianQin and LISA for this kind of binary black hole including detection number and measurement precision. I
discussed probability to identify GW190521-like binary black holes with extremely large orbital eccentricities by
multiband observation of space-borne detectors and the third generation detectors. I also performed the Bayesian method
on constrainding the Hubble constant with this kind of black holes. Meanwhile, I participated in constraining the Hubble
constant with stellar-mass binary black holes by the Bayesian method as one of the most important contributors. Now, I
shifted my attention to hierachical triple systems in Population III star cluslters, which inner binaries are
stellar-mass binary black holes and tertiaies are intermediate-mass black holes. I plan to study intermediate-mass black
holes by stellar-mass black hole around them detected by gravitational waves in three apects: distribution of orbital
eccentricities, evoluiton of orbital eccentricities and multiband observation number. I have completed evolution of
Population III star clusters by $N$-body simulation and selected triple systems. I am trying to detect stellar-mass
binary black holes in triple systems with gravitational waves.

In the future, I am going to 

Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are very important for astronomy and physics, because they may shed
light on the formation of massive black holes, the evolution of galaxies, as well as the effect of dark matter. However, IMBHs
are still elusive, due to the lack of direct observation for them. In the case that the detection for IMBHs with
electromagnetic waves is challenging, gravitational waves are expected to contribute significant help for studying them 
as an entirely new probe. So, my research concentrates on the detection for IMBHs with gravitational waves.

The IMBHs could be sought by observing GW190521-like binary black holes, due to the
remnant of GW190521 with $\sim163M_{\odot}$. This kind of binary black holes would be in the sensitive bands of the
future space-borne gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA and TianQin, and last for several years before they
merge into LIGO/Virgo bands. So, in my past about one year as a postdoctoral researcher, I simulated this kind of binary
black hole in the Universe depending on the masses and merger rate of GW190521. I studied the capacity for detection of GW190521-like
binary black holes with LISA/TianQin and the potential to constrain their formation scenarios by measuring the orbital
eccentricities. As the number of this kind of binary black holes detected increases, more accurate population models will
be released. I will use the updated population model to obtain more accurate predictions of space gravitational wave
detectors. IMBHs with more masses could be formed in globular
clusters, and they would form a hierarchical triple system with stellar-mass binary black holes around them. The IMBHs
will affect the evolution of orbital elements of stellar-mass binary black holes in these systems, making the
gravitational waves from them carry the information on IMBHs. The stellar-mass binary black holes during the above phase
are far away from the merger, they fall in the LISA/TianQin bands. So the hierarchical triple system could be used to
detect the IMBHs in globular clusters, which is the research I am working on. Specially, I simulate the evolution of
globular clusters hosting IMBHs by population syntheses and N-body simulations and select the hierarchical triple
systems. I calculate the waveform from the stellar-mass binary black holes and will study the existence and masses of
IMBHs with the population properties of sources resolved by LISA/TianQin. For the sources undetectable, I plan to use
them to study IMBHs by the multiband observation with LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. This research will provide a novel approach to
detecting IMBHs.

%masses and merger rate of GW190521, and then calculated the expected detection number and source parameter estimation
%precision by the Fisher information matrix. The results showed that LISA/TianQin would be able to tell LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA when and where they would merge to IMBHs in advance, depending on the high estimation precision on merger time and sky localization. In addition, the formation scenarios and sites of
%these sources could be constrained with the orbital eccentricities measurement. IMBHs with more masses could be formed in globular

%detecting IMBHs.

In the future (if I have the honor to join your group), I will shift my attention to detection for intermediate-mass binary black holes (IMBBHs). In the early
University, IMBHs could be formed via the evolution of Population III stars, and then formed IMBBHs. I will generate the IMBBHs by population syntheses and N-body simulations, and explore the capacity of space-borned and ground-based GW detectors for them. After that, I will study the potential to determine whether IMBHs resolved are formed
by this scenario depending on observation. I am also planning to study the extensions of general relativity (GR), because
IMBBHs could be good sources for testing GR. In addition, I plan to do some research on cosmology like constraining the
Hubble constant by IMBHHs. These research will
contribute to the study on the evolution of Population III stars, formation of IMBHs, extensions of GR, dynamical properties of clusters, as well as cosmology.

My current research on hierarchical triple black hole systems is relative to studying the extensions of GR, because the
impact of the tertiary on the GWs from the inner binaries may be degenerate with the modifications of GR. This research
may help break the degeneracy, contributing to the contraining the extensions of GR. In addition, I am willing to adjust my future research plan according to
your needs.

My research field is gravitational wave astronomy, focusing on studying stellar- and intermediate-mass black holes. I am
capable of generating sources by Monte Carlo simulation and population syntheses and N-body simulations. I also know
some data analysis, such Fisher information matrix and Bayesian inference. I have a good cooperative relationship with
experts in TianQin Research Center for Gravitational Physics Sun Yat-sen University, Peking University, and Caltech. I believe that if I am lucky enough to join your team, I can work well with you, benefit from each other, inspire chemistry between us, and enrich your scientific payoff.
