\opening{To whom it may concern,} 
 
    I am writing to express my sincere interest in postdoctoral positions in the area (Machine learning and Data Science
    for cosmology and astroparticle physics, including gravitational wave astrophysics) at SISSA. I would love to
pursue my postdoctoral studies as a member of your team. I am a postdoctoral fellow, who is working on black holes with
    gravitational waves at Sun Yat-sen University.

I have been working on exploring binary black holes with gravitational waves, since I was a PhD candidate. I
    have rich astrophysics knowledge on binary black holes, and experience as well as technical skills in gravitational wave data analysis. During my PhD study, I focused on exploring stellar-mass binary black holes by future
    space-borne gravitational wave detectors (e.g., LISA and TianQin). Specifically, we estimated the strength of
    gravitational wave signals in observation data and detection number, and then estimated
    measurement precision for source parameters with the Fisher information matrix. During my postdoctoral stage, I shifted
    my attention to intermediate-mass black holes. Besides studying GW190521-like binary black holes whose merger remnants are
    intermediate-mass black holes as we explored stellar-mass binary black holes before, we constrained the
    Hubble constant with gravitational wave signals from them by the Bayesian method. Meanwhile, I also participated
    in the project which inferred the Hubble
    constant with gravitational wave signals from stellar-mass binary black holes as one of the most important
    contributors. Now, I am working on
    hierarchical triple
    black hole systems whose perturbers are intermediate-mass black holes in Population III star clusters. I plan to
    study intermediate-mass black holes by detecting gravitational wave signals from stellar-mass binary black holes
    around them. I have completed simulation for Population III
    clusters by $N$-body codes and selected triple systems.  
    In the future, I plan to explore the origin and evolution of massive binary black holes with gravitational wave
    data of future detector networks(e.g., LISA+TianQin) by the hierachical Bayesian inference.

I would appreciate the opportunity to work in your group at SISSA. I am a self-motivated, independent researcher with
    passion for science as well data analysis. I believe that my knowledge,
    technical skills, and experience (e.g., the Bayesian method and $N$-body simulation) on studying black holes by
    gravitational waves could meet your expectations and aid in your research. I have attached my CV and would be very interested in setting up a time further
discuss my skills and qualifications with you. Please let me know whether you have questions and I look forward to
hearing from you.\\

Sincerely,

Shuai Liu
